== Overview ==

Approved Revs is an extension to MediaWiki that lets administrators mark a
certain revision of a page as "approved". The approved revision is the one
displayed when users view the page at its main URL.

For more information, see the extension homepage at:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Approved_Revs

== Requirements ==

This version of the Approved Revs extension requires MediaWiki 1.18 or
higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'ApprovedRevs' directory
within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add the following
line to your 'LocalSettings.php' file:

     require_once( "$IP/extensions/ApprovedRevs/ApprovedRevs.php" );

== Contact ==

Comments, questions, suggestions and bug reports should be sent to Yaron

== Future Considerations ==
Possibly adding the following types:
* No Repeat - most recent approver cannot approve (so you get new people approving)
* Significant - Only people who have made significant contributions prior to current approved rev can approve it
* Property:PROP_NAME - So you can define a property PROP_NAME that points to a user or users who can approve the page
* Require:2 - Method to say number of people to mark approved prior to changing the approved revision
