<noinclude>[[File:Approval Star.png|right|frame|Approval Required Star]]Adds approvability and valid approvers to files

== Template Purpose ==
This template is intended to be used on pages in the "File" namespace and performs three functions:
# Adds the category [[:Category:Approved Revision Required]], which should be set in [[MediaWiki:Approvedrevs-permissions]] as requiring approvals. Adding the category to this page sets the file as approvable.
# Adds the star icon shown above to the file page, indicating that this file requires approved revisions
# Sets any people listed as allowed to approve the file's revisions

== Standard Usage ==
The following would set the file as approvable, allowing Stephanie and James to approve it.
<pre>
{{Approved Revision File|User:Jamesmontalvo3,User:Yaron Koren}}
</pre>

See [[:Category:Approved Revision Required]] for more information. See [[Special:ApprovedRevs]] for lists of approved and approvable files and pages.{{#if:{{{1|}}}|&nbsp;
